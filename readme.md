# This was my test file to learn how to use git

# When you want to start a local repository you must initialise git in that directory.
# After that, if you make a change, you need to add it to the staging area.
# When you are sure everything works then you can commit the change with a message.

# To add the local repository to a remote repository you have to authenticate yourself with git.
# Then you push the code to github.
# Later you can pull the code from github to check if there are any changes.
# You can also merge code
